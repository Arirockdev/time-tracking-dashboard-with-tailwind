# Frontend Mentor - Time tracking dashboard

![Design preview for the Time tracking dashboard coding challenge](./src/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Hi I just finished, this challenge from frontend mentor.

The last challenge I use HTML, CSS grid and JavaScript vanilla, but and this new version I use:
  - HTML
  - TailwindCss
  - JavaScript
  
For the Javascript section, I decide use classes and methods, from OOP.



## This is the [link](https://github.com/Arirockdev/time-tracking-dashboard-with-tailwind.git) for the deploy project.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
